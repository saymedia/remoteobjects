This will benchmark remoteobjects decoding speed. It will decode the JSON data
you specify as the first argument into the remoteobject subclass you specify as
the second argument. The decode process is run as many times as you specify (via
the -n flag). The raw times to decode the JSON data will be dumped to stdout.
