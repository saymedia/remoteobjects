    Endpoints in APIs are often not objects themselves but lists of objects.

    As with regular `PromiseObject` instances, `PageObject` instances can be
    filtered by parameters that are then passed to your target API, such as a
    list of recent objects or a search. Filtering a `PageObject` instance by a
    parameter returns a new copy of that `PageObject` instance that includes
    the new parameter.

    The contents of regular `PageObject` instances will be decoded as with
    `Field` fields; that is, not decoded at all. To customize decoding of API
    contents, subclass `PageObject` and redefine the ``entries`` member with a
    `Field` instance that decodes the list content as necessary.

    As many API endpoints are sets of objects, to create a `PageObject`
    subclass for those endpoints, you can directly call its metaclass,
    `PageOf`, with the class reference you would use to construct an `Object`
    field. That is, these declarations are equivalent:

    >>> from remoteobjects import fields, RemoteObject
    >>> from remoteobjects.listobject import PageObject, PageOf
    >>> class Entry(RemoteObject): pass
    >>> PageOfEntry = PageOf(Entry)

    >>> class PageOfEntry(PageObject):
    ...     entries = fields.List(fields.Object(Entry))

    For an ``Entry`` list you then fetch with the `PageOfEntry` class's
    `get()` method, all the entities in the list resource's `entries` member
    will be decoded into ``Entry`` instances.
